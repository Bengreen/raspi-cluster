Your new web app is ready to go!

To run your app you'll need to:

1. Activate a python 3.6 or 3.7 environment
2. Install the required packages with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Make sure the app's settings are configured correctly (see `app/settings.py`). You can also
 use environment variables to define sensitive settings, eg. DB connection variables
4. You can then run your app during development with `adev runserver -s gateway/static gateway`


# Run server
